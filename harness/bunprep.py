"""bunprep.py: bun's Rust port (oven-sh/bun from v1.4) as a workspace whose executable rustc links.

    bunprep.py CHECKOUT    prepares CHECKOUT-native (below) and prints the environment

Bun's own build (`bun scripts/build.ts`) compiles its C and C++ with ninja (JavaScriptCore from a
prebuilt WebKit, BoringSSL, uSockets, ...), builds its Rust as one static library
(`bun_runtime`) and links the two with clang. ra-jit builds and splices executables that rustc
links, so the tree measured has one more workspace member, `bun-exe`: a `#![no_main]` binary of
`bun_runtime`, whose `main` it is, with the native objects and libraries on rustc's link line.

`prepare(checkout)` copies the clone (which nothing writes to) to `CHECKOUT-native` once per
revision and configures bun's release build there without LTO. Ninja then builds what bun's link
step (in build.ninja) takes besides bun's Rust, the code that Rust includes and the dependencies
it has under `vendor/`, but not the Rust: that is what is measured. The native half of the link
step goes to a file of link arguments that `bun-exe`'s build script reads (BUN_NATIVE_LINK_ARGS),
and the member is added. It returns that tree, to be copied without its `build` directory, and
the environment every build of it needs: bun's pinned toolchain, the code bun's build generated
(BUN_CODEGEN_DIR) and the link arguments. `in_place(ws)` does the same in a checkout of its own
(apps.py's `prepare`).

What bun's build needs is on PATH: what docs/project/contributing.mdx lists (LLVM 23, cmake,
ninja, go, a bun to run its scripts), as `nix develop .#bench-bun` has it, whose only Rust is
bun's pinned nightly. With rustup, that nightly is installed when it is missing.
docs/research/bun.md says what was measured with it.
