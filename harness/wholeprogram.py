"""wholeprogram.py: programs ra-jit builds whole, with a `main` of its own, run as cargo's do.

usage: wholeprogram.py [CASE...] [--release] [--keep]

Each case is a program of the workspace `harness/wholeprogram`, copied to a directory of
its own. Cargo builds it as it is, and again with ra-jit as `RUSTC_WRAPPER` and
`RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` as `runbench.py` builds a program: rustc builds the registry's
crates and stand-ins of no code for the workspace's, and ra-jit compiles every crate of the
program into one object, with the C `main` of it, which is linked in their place. Both
programs run, and what they print on either stream and the status they exit with have to be
the same.

  default_alloc  the default allocator; output on both streams and a status of its own
  custom_alloc   a `#[global_allocator]` of the program that counts what it is asked for
  lib_alloc      the `#[global_allocator]` is in a library of the workspace

The backend is `RA_JIT_BACKEND`'s; `--release` builds both with the release profile.
