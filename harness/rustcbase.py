"""rustcbase.py: the first edits after a cold `cargo ra-jit build`, which the daemon splices into
the executable rustc linked (issue #11), against plain cargo.

    rustcbase.py [--work DIR] [SCENARIO...]

Writes a workspace of two crates (a program and a library it calls) into WORK/ws. Each scenario
starts from an empty target directory, RA_JIT_HOME and store: `cargo ra-jit build`, then once
the daemon is ready its edits one after the other, each built by `cargo ra-jit build` and by
`cargo build` into a target directory of its own. Both programs run without arguments and with
`panic`; stdout, stderr and the exit status must be the same. Each edit also has the way it was
built checked: `patch` when it was spliced into the executable it had (rustc's, or the daemon's
own once it built one), `full` when the daemon built the program in full first. A scenario's
`wait` is how long it waits once ready, which lets the daemon build its own base meanwhile.
The `cached-` scenarios have a program with a `#[ra_jit::cache]` function instead, whose
results are kept in WORK/fn-cache.

Exits 1 when an output differs or an edit was built another way than the scenario says.
