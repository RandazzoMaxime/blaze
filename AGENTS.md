# ra-jit

How to build, test and change ra-jit, including the vendored rust-analyzer, is
[docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md); what the harnesses check is
[docs/harness.md](docs/harness.md).

- **ra-jit never runs rustc.** ra-jit compiles everything itself: no function, crate,
  standard library, build script, proc macro, check, test, doctest or link step is handed to
  rustc, rustdoc or a cargo that runs them, and there is no "fall back to cargo" path. Each place
  that still does is a bug with a `no-rustc` issue, to be removed, never extended or added to:
  [docs/no-rustc.md](docs/no-rustc.md).
- **Language semantics go in the rust-analyzer subtree.** MIR building and passes, borrow
  checking, const eval, layout and code-identity hashes as salsa queries (what rustc keeps in
  `rustc_middle`, `rustc_mir_transform`, `rustc_borrowck`) go in `vendor/rust-analyzer`, as a
  new crate there rather than edits to upstream's files where possible; codegen backends,
  object writing, the splice, the daemon, cargo integration, the store, tiers, the live runtime
  and the harnesses stay in `crates/`: [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md#where-new-code-goes).
- **Heavy work runs on a dev host, the Mac does quick checks.** Release builds, harness sweeps
  and benchmarks run on an AWS dev host claimed in the host ledger (`fleet-ops` skill), with a
  lease as long as the run, released after: [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md#working-in-parallel).
- **One worktree per lane, never `git stash`.** A uniquely named worktree with its own
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` or a shared sccache; the stash is shared by every worktree; harnesses run
  with `RUST_BACKTRACE=0`.
- **Land small and often, through the merge queue only.** After the local gate, run
  `python3 .github/scripts/land.py "what the branch does"` in the lane's worktree: it opens the
  pull request, queues it and waits until the fast tier (about 10 minutes) has passed on it
  merged onto main and it is merged, or says why not. Its waiting survives a tool that kills
  it; `land.py --wait` picks it up again. Never push to main or merge into it by
  hand: [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md#landing-a-change).
- **Delete what a lane made when it is done:** its worktree, target directory and dev-host
  directories, and its merged branch.
- **Credit people.** A commit or pull request built on someone's suggestion, diagnosis,
  workaround or patch from an issue, review or discussion gets a
  `Co-authored-by: Name <id+login@users.noreply.github.com>` trailer for each of them, and names
  where it came from: [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md#credit).
